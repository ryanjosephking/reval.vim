reval.vim - Quick edit/filter/see loop, especially for regex testing.

= Intro =

The idea comes from (sites like) http://rubular.com/ where you can input a
regex, then see it filter the results. Though a really cool use of AJAX, who
would rather be in a web form than in their very own text editor?

Hence reval.vim. All it does is use your top buffer as the argument to "perl
-pe", then uses the left buffer as that command's stdin, with the right buffer
capturing stdout. This means that, though it is geared for regex testing by
default, you could do anything with the loop that you want.

= Install =

This part is not very refined. At the moment, what I would do is:
mkdir -p ~/.vim/plugin; ln -s `pwd`/reval.vim $_
...TODO

= Options =

You can set these options:
 * In your ~/.reval.vimrc with let g:revallang = 'ruby'
 * Within vim with :let g:revallang = 'ruby'
 * From the command-line with vim +'let g:revallang = ruby'
 * In your vim rc files with let g:revallang = 'ruby'

g:revallang - Switches the file, cmd, and "body"-regexp to match your language
  choice. Currently available: perl and ruby. Default is:
    let g:revallang = 'perl'

g:revalrunner - The command and arguments to use for the filter.
  Default when 'perl' == g:revallang is:
    let g:revalrunner = 'perl -p'

g:revalfile - The filename of the loop body itself. The extension will hint
  vim on how to syntax highlight. Default when 'perl' == g:revallang is:
    let g:revalfile = '/tmp/reval.pm'

g:revalbody - The starting contents of your buffer. 
  Default when 'perl' == g:revallang is:
    let g:revalbody = 's//â€¦/g'

g:revalinput - The file to use for input. Default is:
  let g:revalinput = '/tmp/revalinput'

g:revalcmd - Pieces together the previous bits to make the actual command. If
  you want to get really fancy, this is the way to control it. After
  executing, reval.vim will use this command's stdout for the output buffer.
  Default is:
    let g:revalcmd = g:revalrunner.' '.g:revalfile.' 2>&1 < '.g:revalinput

= For More =

An amazing, interactive regex lesson is here:
  * Get on Freenode IRC - http://freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml
  * /join #regex  (So the bot will talk to you -- but it's a good
      channel, anyway)
  * /msg pork !register yournick apassword
  * /msg pork !regexquiz
  * ...then have fun!

Some regex resources are:
  * Perl's Documentation - http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html
  * http://rubular.com/ - A web version of this script (Ruby)
  * http://regextester.com/ - ...same, for JavaScript, Perl, and PHP REs
